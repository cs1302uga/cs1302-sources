cs1302-api-tools
################

The |cs1302_sources| project provides a library for fetching responses from
|rest_like|_ APIs that are hosted as web services. Its simple yet flexible
request and response patterns leverage the ``java.net.http`` module that was
introduced in Java 11, and support response payloads formatted in various
types (e.g., JSON, XML, and plain text).

More details coming soon!
