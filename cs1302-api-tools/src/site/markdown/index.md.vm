**${project.description}**

The goal of this project is to provide a simple library for working with
[REST-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
APIs that are hosted as web services. API requests are made using the
[`HttpClient`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html)
class that was introduced in Java 11, and support is provided for
response payloads formatted in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON),
[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), and plain text.
